# How to Execute

1. Run the Server first in Server/server.py
2. Choose client inside one of 'Client' folders, then run client.py
3. The client console will display how to make a command or operation
4. By default, files sent by client or Server will be saved in Downloads folder, meanwhile Files folder contains files that client or Server is going to get
5. If you want to change the directory name for Files or Downloads folder, you can do it simply by just changing the variables inside server.py and client.py (but make sure both folders already exist before proceeding the program)

// Typing slowly is recommended
